#A talkative person is using a public phone; Clark Kent is waiting for the phone booth to be free so that he can change into his Superman costume. Suppose that the time 𝑇 (in minutes) until the talkative person is through has an exponential density with parameter 𝜆 = .1.

#a. What is the probability that Clark Kent will have to wait for more than 5 minutes?

1 - pexp(5,.1)

#b. What is the probability that Clark Kent will have to wait for between 5 and 10 minutes?

pexp(10,.1) - pexp(5,.1)

#c. The person has already been talking for 15 minutes. What is the probability that Clark Kent will have to wait for an additional amount of time greater than 5 minutes?

(1 - pexp(20,.1)) / (1 - pexp(15,.1))

#d. You should have gotten the same answer for c. as you got for a., which means that the probability of waiting an additional time of more than 5 minutes doesn’t change even if Clark Kent already has waited 15 minutes. In fact you can check that the probability of waiting an additional time of more than 5 minutes given that he has already waited 𝑡 minutes is the same no matter what the value of 𝑡 is. This is an example of what is called the “memoryless” property of the exponential distribution. Check that the probability that Clark Kent will have to wait for an additional amount of time greater than 5 minutes, given that he already has waited for 25 minutes, is the same.

#Using the normal density with 𝜇 = 50 cm and 𝜎 = 5 cm as a model for the length of catfish in a lake, answer the following questions. Draw an appropriate picture of a normal density for each question.

#a. If a catfish is selected at random, what is the probability that it is more than 60 cm in length?

1 - pnorm(60,50,5)

#b. What is the length 𝑥 such that exactly 10% of catfish are shorter than 𝑥?

#x is 43.59224; 10% of catfish or less are 43.59224 cm long

#c. What is the length 𝑦 such that exactly 70% of catfish are longer than 𝑦?

qnorm(.30,50,5)

#y is 47.378; 30% of catfish are 47.378 cm long, which means that 70% of catfish are
#greater than 47.378 cm

#Let 𝑋 be a random variable with 𝜇 = 80 and 𝜎 = 10.

#d. The relationships among normal densities suggest that you should get the same answers to these three questions no matter what the values of 𝜇 and 𝜎. Verify that this is true by calculating the same three quantities, but this time for a standard normal distribution, i.e., a normal distribution with 𝜇 = 0 and 𝜎 = 1

#You are the data scientist at a pharmaceutical startup. Over the next 4 years the startup is expected to discover new drugs at a random rate which can be fit as a Poisson process with a rate of 5/year. Each drug thus discovered has a 15% chance of obtaining FDA approval.

#a. Do 10,000 simulations of the number of drugs that will be discovered. Plot a histogram of the results.

sim = rpois(10000,5)

hist(sim,main="Distribution of drugs discovered over 10,000 simulations",xlab="Number of Drugs discovered per year",ylab = "Amount")

#b. Next, use those 10,000 simulations to determine the number of drugs which will survive FDA approval. Plot a histogram of those results.

#lambda = rate = 5/year
#.15 is 15 percent chance to obtain approval

x = sample(sim,1500)

#3 drugs discovered per year, that also obtain FDA approval
sim2 = rpois(10000,x)

hist(sim2,main="Distribution of drugs discovered that get FDA Approval",xlab = "Number of drugs that survived in a given year",ylab = "Amount")

#c. Each drug obtaining FDA approval will give the startup revenue which fits an exponential distribution with parameter $10,000,000. Use the simulations to model the amount of revenue, and then plot a histogram of the revenue results.

#Multiplying each FDA approved drug by 10 (in millions) to get profits
sim3 = sim2*10

hist(sim3,xlab="Revnue per Drug Discovered (in millions)",ylab = "Amount of FDA approved drugs by amount discovered per year")

#d. The R&D cost for the startup is $26,000,000. Find the percent of simulation results for which the startup makes a profit.

z = 0

for(i in sim3)
  if(i>=26)
    z = z + 1

#Percent chance that the start up has profit over the simulation
print(z/10000)

#e. You are asked to determine business strategy to determine whether more money should be spent on R&D or marketing. If the money is spent on R&D, 20% more drugs will be discovered, so that drugs will be discovered at a rate of 6 per year instead of 5. If the money is spent on marketing, the revenue for each drug will be increased by 20%, so that each drug’s revenue will fit an exponential distribution with parameter $12,000,000. Which alternative will yield higher revenue on average for the startup?


#Increasing the drug discovery rate will yield an overall higher revenue than increasing marketing
